# Farm YouTube engagement using live thumbnails

Growth strategy: users who comment on your video appear on your thumbnail in semi-real-time.

### Your video ID

![Find your YouTube video ID](./README/find-your-youtube-video-id.jpg)

### Your thumbnail
To keep things simple, the sample thumbnail has 5 slots for PFPs (positions are hard-coded) but this can easily be changed. For example, you can paste hundreds of small PFPs covering the entire thumbnail. Check Google's docs for thumbnail limitations (e.g., must be <2MB).

### Your YouTube API access
Using an API key is simple for reads (listing comments) but OAuth is required for writes (setting thumbnails). Unfortunately, there is no silver-bullet (permanent auth) for backend to backend (this webapi to YouTube's API). You will need to perform an initial interactive login as the channel owner to obtain a refresh token, which will then become an environment variable to ensure the access token stays fresh.

Lifespan of a refresh token? as of writing, they appear to be long-lived (~600k seconds â‰ˆ 7 days). This is plenty of time for this project's purpose. Recommend storing in a secrets vault (e.g., Azure Key Vault) and restart the webapi/create an operational endpoint to hot reload the YouTube client with the new refresh token.

1. Create [.env](./.env) to populate in the subsequent steps
   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. To get the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, generate your Google OAuth Client [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (desktop to avoid specifying origins and redirect URLs etc)
   ![How to generate YouTube API key step 1](./README/how-to-create-youtube-oauth-client.jpg)
3. Before the next step, you may need to add your account (channel owner account) as a test user if your app is unpublished
   ![How to add your account as a test user](./README/how-to-set-test-users.jpg)
4. To get the **Refresh Token**, run the script (will launch your browser) and login
   ```shell
   chmod +x script_to_obtain_refresh_token.py
   ./script_to_obtain_refresh_token.py
   ```
5. You now have the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, add **Refresh Token**, add them to [.env](./.env)
6. That's it for environment variables!
7. If you are a new channel, YouTube may block you from setting custom thumbnails. To fix this, attempt to change it via the YouTube frontend and Google will ask you to verify.

<summary>2. How do I use it?</summary>

- Assumes you're using asdf (last using Python 3.13.7)
- Assumes your YouTube API daily quota is full (wait 24h if not)
- How to start the web API? Run in [root](.)
  ```shell
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  fastapi dev app
  ```
- How to test the web API? See [app.http](app.http) then cURL or [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)
- Generated (test and official) thumbnails will go [here](./generated_thumbnail/)

<summary>3. FAQ</summary>

### _"What are the next steps?"_

- Run the web API on a VPS, example: [Digital Ocean Droplet @ $4/month](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing)
- Run a CRON job on the VPS to trigger endpoint every X minutes, example:
  ```shell
  */4 * * * * curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:8000/farm-engagement?limit={{num_of_top_comments}}&video_id={{video_id}}" > /dev/null 2>&1
  ```
- Persist current progress in an external DB (users processed so far, cursor position to paste next PFP, latest thumbnail created, etc)

### _"So this gets the top comments?"_
YouTube's _order by relevance_ query param when fetching the top comments is not the same algo as the one you see on YouTube's frontend - they are similar (enough to get the job done) but not 1:1.

### _"Why not just fetch all comments so we have more control?"_
Yes this guarentees that we always rank comments with 100% accuracy and allows us to promise for example "top 3 comments with the most likes get chosen...". This is a tradeoff issue between using more of our daily quota VS maintaining a near-real-time cadence for thumbnail updates.

This accuracy would require more reads (for pagination) and more compute to re-check all comments each run (old comments can gain more likes). It would be smart to scale down the interval for updating the thumbnail based on the remaining quota. For this demo, prioritize simplicity: get the top 100 comments based on Google's relevance ordering.

### _"Any improvements?"_
- You can add funnels to only process users who have liked/commented/subscribed - maxxing interactions.
- (maybe go in next steps/combine these sections) Persist the current progress in a DB  (cursor position for the next pfp, latest banner, etc) and load each run to ensure resiliency (no data loss upon server restarts, crahes, etc)
- More dynamic (lower image quality if over 2MB limit), dynamic cadence (scale down) based on available quota, fetch comments paginated (users more reads)
